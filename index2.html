  <p class="my-4">A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to the user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program, and its usually the very first program people write when they are new to the language.</p>

  <p>Though the origins of Hello World remain somewhat unclear, its use as a test phrase is widely believed to have begun with Brian Kernigham’s 1972 book, A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B. In this text, the first known version of the program was used to illustrate external variables. Because the previous example in the tutorial printed “hi!” on the terminal, the more complex “hello, world!” required more character constants for expression and was the next step in the learning process.
From there, it was used in a Bell Laboratories memo in 1974, as well as The C Programming Language in 1978. This popular text is what made Hello World famous. The example from that book (the first, and most pure, example) printed “hello, world,” with no capital letters or exclamation point. At this time, Hello World was used almost solely to illustrate a few functions of a language— not to test whether the system was running.
Before Kernigham’s seminal texts on B and C, there was no standard first program. Even as late as 1972, it was not widely in use. The popular BASIC tutorial, “My Computer Likes Me, When I Speak in Basic,” starts with a simple program that writes a line of text. However, this message was “MY HUMAN UNDERSTANDS ME,” far from the two-word greeting programmers use today. But once Hello World was invented, it spread quickly, becoming well-known by the late 1970s. Its popularity continues to this day...</p>
